mod features: Lumen GI/reflection improvements, Virtual shadow maps support, FSR SSR bug fix, presets for quick and easy installation, research file with all my findings

discord server: https://discord.gg/3cH7NXPt (for troubleshooting, suggestions, changelogs, pretty much anything)

This is currently an experimental build, theres only limited testing at this time, performance impacts of some presets arent clear, and the presets require more refinment
rendering resolution also effects the render distance of VSM's so take that into account 

installation:
copy the engine.ini(and Scalability.ini) here %localAppdata%\FactoryGame\saved\config\Windows and overwrite the vanilla files with the same names

recommended in game settings:
for VSM's to work you must set the in game shadow quality to ultra
i also recommends setting lumen to the high setting in game
as well as that i also recommend selecting DLSS/FSR as upscaling (FSR for AMD/GTX GPU owners, DLSS for RTX GPU owners)
you can do whatever you want with the rest of the settings
