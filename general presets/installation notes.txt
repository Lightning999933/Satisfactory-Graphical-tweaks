the presets here inprove lumens GI and reflections quality and some other things
 the higher preset you choose the lower your performance will get, lumen will become less noisy with less obvious artifacts, and grass density will increase
  (to avoid confusion, quality scales like this: vanilla < low < recommended < medium < high < perfectionist)
 your performance (fps) will also impact the quality of lumen (further explained in the research files)

how to install:
1st pick a preset of your choosing (the recommended preset is well, recommended)
2nd insert the engine.ini file into %localAppdata%\FactoryGame\saved\config\Windows and overwrite the vanilla file with the same name (dont worry this wont mess anything up)
3rd launch the game and enable global illumination in the menu (recommended at high) and you are done !

additionally:
to get the best quality: use an upscaler preferably whichever one fits your GPU brand (unless you have a GTX GPU in which case its up to you) or use TSR (which isn't branded)
and set them to the highest modes you can afford performance wise, why ? because they are higher quality than the games default AA method (TAA)
