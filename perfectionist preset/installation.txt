this is the highest quality setting for this mod, it will run like garbage, dont expect good performance, this mode is not meant for normal gameplay, only for taking screenshots
   (to avoid confusion, quality scales like this: vanilla < low < recommended < medium < high < perfectionist)

installation:
copy the engine.ini and Scalability.ini here %localAppdata%\FactoryGame\saved\config\Windows and overwrite the vanilla files with the same names

additionally:
to get the best quality: use an upscaler preferably whichever one fits your GPU brand (unless you have a GTX GPU in which case its up to you) or use TSR (which isn't branded)
and set them to the highest modes you can afford performance wise, why ? because they are higher quality than the games default AA method (TAA)
